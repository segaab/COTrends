    <h2>About the Dashboard</h2>
    <p>
        This dashboard watches sectors for incoming growth. It tracks the performance of the sector leader and sees how the rest of the sector follows. 
        When the leader pulls ahead, it’s a sign that new capital is entering the market. The rest of the sector usually confirms this trend as the momentum spreads.

    <h2>Key Features</h2>

    <h2>Who It’s For</h2>
    <p>
        The dashboard is built for retail investors, especially those aged 25–35, who want to spot growth early, follow market leaders, and make more informed trading decisions.

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>
        We track normalized stock prices to see how a leader performs versus its peers. When the leader pulls ahead, it signals a potential sector growth wave. 
        As other stocks start to follow, the dashboard confirms the wave and highlights the phase the sector is in. This makes it easier to spot growth opportunities and potential interruptions before they happen.
